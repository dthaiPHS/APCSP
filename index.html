		<p>To me, junior year so far is not as horrible as many people will talk about. Perhaps it is because of the types of classes that I have chosen. Although I'm taking some weighted classes, they aren't horribly stressful as of now. However I would say that they are quite challenging.</p>

		<h3>Favorite Book</h3>
		<img src = "greatGatsby.jpg" width = "25%">
		<p>I really like the book The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Ever since I read it during junior year English, it has stuck with me because of its themes and how well-written it is. I would definitely recommend it!</p>
