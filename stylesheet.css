/*
This code selects all images and gives them rounded edges and a shadow. There is a
transition assigned to the images that lasts for 0.3 seconds that eases in and out.

In the second code segment, when the user hovers their cursor over an image, there is a transformation
of a scale of 1.1, which enlarges the image. This is for the same transition mentioned earlier.
